`Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I-
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydreams, I-
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Oh, forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (see you again)

Can I get a kiss? (Can I)
And can you make it last forever? (Can You?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (‘bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again (uh, switch it up)

I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Ugh!
